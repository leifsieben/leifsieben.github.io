## About Me
Hi! I'm Leif (pronounced like "life", it's that easy) and it's great you're here. You'll have to figure out yourself why exactly. This website is mostly an archive of my own for my own but it's great if you find anything useful here. I was born in Germany, grew up near Lucerne in Switzerland and I am currently studying Interdiscplinary Sciences at ETH Zurich with a major in chemistry and computer science. 

## Education 
- MSc. Thesis at MIT in the group of Jim J. Collins. 
- MSc. in Interdisciplinary Sciences (Chemistry, Computer Science), ETH Zurich.
- BSc. in Interdisciplinary Sciences (Chemistry, Biology), ETH Zurich.
- Matura at Kantonsschule Alpenquai (bilingual, valedictorian), Luzern. 

## Research Projects
Here are the research projects that I have been involved in over the years. You'll find the links to the relevant articles in due time, until then you can also find them on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JoZlcK0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or via my [ORC-ID](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-9990-4896).

## Teaching
Teaching is society's way to let smarty-pants cash in on their precociousness. I have amply provided the world with mine both cost-free and for gainly employment approximately since the day I learned how to talk. At ETH I have taught the following courses, giving a 45 min recitation each week for 15-25 people.

-Physical Chemistry I - Thermodynamics (2x)
-Inorganic Chemistry I - Coordination Chemistry
-Organic Chemistry I - Introduction to Organic Chemistry for Biologists
-Physical Chemistry III - Quantum Mechanics

## TEDx Talk 2022
If your interested in the power of scientific thinking and my own story in science you can also take a look at the [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rql940dY1b4) I gave a while back.
