        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Leif (pronounced like "life", it's that easy) and it's great you're here. You'll have to figure out yourself why exactly. This website is mostly an archive of my own for my own but it's great if you find anything useful here. 
            I was born in Germany, grew up near Lucerne in Switzerland and I am currently studying Interdiscplinary Sciences at ETH Zurich with a major in chemistry and computer science.

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p> Teaching is society's way to let smarty-pants cash in on their precociousness. I have amply provided the world with mine both cost-free and for gainly employment approximately since the day I learned how to talk. At ETH I have taught the following courses, giving a 45 min recitation each week for 15-25 people.</a> </p>
      <ul>
          <li> Physical Chemistry I - Thermodynamics </li>
          <li> Inorganic Chemistry I - Coordination Chemistry </li>

   <h2>Philosophy of Chemistry</h2>
   <p> I have been a contributing writer for both the Chemistry department's student newspaper "Exsikkator" and the ETH wide student newspaper "Polykum" writing a column on the philosophy of chemistry and science respectively. 
      Some - but by no means all - of this writing was inspired by my own experiences in the lab. You can find the articles below. </p>

<section id="nagarjuna">
   <h2>The Apology of Nagarjuna</h2>
   <p> In my matura thesis, I treat the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (ca. 2nd century CE) who was revolutionary in the development of Buddhism as he was the first philosopher willing to question the teachings of the Buddha and to put these onto an independent philosophical basement. His teaching remains enormously influential, if nearly completely unknown in the West, as he initiated the "reform Buddhism" known as Mahayana, which encompasses many of today's best known types of Buddhism such as Zen Buddhism. In this work I attempted to use and extend Boolean algebra developed by Graham priest to make Nagarjuna more understandable to a Western audience and to prove the point that his arguments do have philosophical and even logical rigour. Nagarjuna is by no means simply a esoteric thinker concerned with mystical enlightenment but a uniquely sharp and original philosopher in his own right.</a> </p>

<section id="alchemy">
   <h2>Alchemy</h2>
   <p>In 2023 I was involved in organizing a seminar on the topic of alchemy for the Swiss Study Foundation. The seminar was in part inspired by the amazing book by James Elkins "What painting is", a beautiful melange of 
      art history, chemistry and why alchemy is such a powerful metaphor for oil painting, as well as the operette "Alchemy" by Roald Hoffmann, a chemist. The seminar included talks on the history of ideas, art history, chemistry and crucially also by living, practicing alchemists to a broad audience of 
      young Swiss students. There were a number of outstanding talks there and I hope to continue working on this topic. If anyone is willing to collaborate on any topic related to this please, regardless your background, do reach out. </p>
   <ul>
       <li> Prof. Dr. Peter Forshaw, University of Amsterdam - Introduction to Alchemy </li>
       <li> Prof. Dr. Aden Kumlar, University of Basel - Transformations, Transsubstantiations: medieval ars and art </li>
       <li> Prof. Dr. Gerd Folkers - Is Chemistry the only Creative Science? </li>
       <li> Peter Cati - An Alchemical Distillatio </li>
